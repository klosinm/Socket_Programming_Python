[Data Comm] We will implement a FTP client program and a FTP server program for a simple file transfer


The implemented FTP application supports text files transfer. The client program presents a command line interface that allows a user to:
•	Connect to a server
•	List files stored at the server.
•	Download (retrieve) a file from the server.
•	Upload (store) a file from the client to the server.
•	Terminate the connection to the server.
